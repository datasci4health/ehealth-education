This roadmap follows a top-down approach (from more generic to more specific) to present key issues concerning the **Virtual Patient** subject.
## 1. Overview in Health Care Education
This chapter of the book **Biomedical Informatics** gives an overview of education and technologies in the health care context.

> Dev, P., & Schleyer, T. K. L. (2014). **Computers in Health Care Education**. In E. H. Shortliffe & J. J. Cimino (Eds.), Biomedical Informatics (pp. 675–693). Springer. [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4474-8_23](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4474-8_23)

It starts presenting theories of learning and follows detailing computer and tools:
* Drill and Practice
* Digital Lectures
* Exploration Versus Structured Interaction
* Scenario-, Case- and Problem- Based Learning
* Learning Through Design
* Simulation
* Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Mentoring, Feedback and Guidance
It presents the contexts and public targets in health care education, its ecosystem including learning objects, and finishes presenting future directions.

This is the textbook of the course [Biomedical Computing - Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-950j-biomedical-computing-fall-2010/index.htm).

There is a more recent and recommended chapter, but until this date it is not available under CAPES Portal (brazilian access on public universities):

> Dev, P., & Schleyer, T. (2021). **Digital Technology in Health Science Education**. In E. H. Shortliffe & J. J. Cimino (Eds.), Biomedical Informatics (pp. 841–865). Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58721-5_25
## 2. Probabilistic Clinical Reasoning and Evidence-based Medicine
This chapter addresses how doctors reason in a probabilistic way to make decisions and the role of evidence-based medicine to guide them in decision making. It is fundamental to understanding the connection between data science and education. The chapter is designed to non-specialists:

> Owens, D. K., & Sox, H. C. (2014). **Biomedical Decision Making: Probabilistic Clinical Reasoning**. In E. H. Shortliffe & J. J. Cimino (Eds.), Biomedical Informatics (pp. 67–107). Springer. [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4474-8_3]

It is guided by practical cases and explains the roles of pretest and post-test. This chapter is the best overview to start figuring out how to apply data science to produce educational content.

There is a more recent and recommended chapter, but until this date it is not available under CAPES Portal (brazilian access on public universities):

> Owens, D. K., Goldhaber-Fiebert, J. D., & Sox, H. C. (2021). **Biomedical Decision Making: Probabilistic Clinical Reasoning**. In Biomedical Informatics (pp. 77–120). Springer. [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58721-5_3]

## 3. Virtual Patient
3.1. This article is the first step for understanding the concept of virtual patients. It presents an overview of the approach inserting it inside a wider scenario of instructional modalities:

> Cook, D. A., & Triola, M. M. (2009). **Virtual patients: a critical literature review and proposed next steps**. Medical Education, 43(4), 303–311. [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03286.x]

3.2. This article presents an excellent overview of key aspects of virtual patients and the challenges to produce and share open them.

> Ellaway, R., Poulton, T., Fors, U., McGee, J., & Albright, S. (2008). **Building a virtual patient commons**. Medical Teacher, 30(2), 170–174. [https://doi.org/10.1080/01421590701874074]

It addresses virtual patient patterns:
* Linear-passive
* Linear-interactive
* Branching
* Student-authored
* Knowledgebase contextualisation
* Several encounters
It also discusses virtual patient requirements:
* Feedback and reporting
* User agency and autonomy
* Validity and fidelity
* Pacing and cognitive load

3.3. This thesis presents a very good overview including virtual patients and data-driven concerns:

> Babichenko, D. (2018). **Designing Data-Driven Virtual Patients for Health Sciences Education**. University of Pittsburgh. [https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/designing-data-driven-virtual-patients-health/docview/2478007765/se-2?accountid=8113]

Since it is a long text, one can go deep in topics that are more related with one's own interests.

It details simulation types:
* Standardized patients
* Mannequin simulators
* Specialized procedure simulators / task trainers
* In-game scenarios
* Electronic Virtual patients (VP)
  * Linear VP cases
  * Branched-narrative VP cases
It also details virtual patient case authoring, focusing on the vpSim platform.

3.4. This edition is a special issue on virtual patients. Even though it is not recent, it presents a rich and wide overview of perspectives and initiatives around virtual patients:

> Roterman-Konieczna, I. (Ed.). (2010). **Bio-Algorithms and Med-Systems (Vol. 6, Issue 11)**. Jagiellonian University - Medical College. [https://bit.wl.cm.uj.edu.pl/cm/uploads/2021/02/bams6_11.pdf]

One can do a shallow quick reading (titles and abstracts) of the articles, in order to select some of them to full reading according to one's own interests.
