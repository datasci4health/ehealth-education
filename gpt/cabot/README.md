## Case 1

A liquor dealer, 47 years old, is seen December 15, 1904. His father died at 67 of "obstruction of the bowels", his mother at 63 of pneumonia. He regularly used whiskey and beer to excess up to 1891 when he had an attack of bloody vomiting after a debauch. He had a similar attack in 1895 and again in 1902. He never was kept in bed more than a few days, and always returned to business within a week. After each attack he gave up all alcohol for periods varying from six months to two years and then relapsed into his former habits. He has suffered for years from digestive disturbances, "sour stomach", which have been much worse during his periods of alcoholism. After twenty months of abstinence he began to drink about three months ago, and since then has complained of anorexia, pain, eructation of gas, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is located in the epigastrium, comes on ten to fifteen minutes after eating and is relieved by vomiting. On the afternoon of December 11 he vomited a small quantity of bright red blood, and since then he has vomited after nearly every meal, but he has noticed blood only on one other occasion, two days ago, when he threw up nearly a pint. He has noticed black stools for several days. He has recently lost about 15 lbs. ; present weight 185. Mucous membranes pale. Heart normal in size, action regular, soft systolic murmur at apex, not transmitted. Pulmonic second sound not accentuated. Abdomen tympanitic throughout, slight tenderness on pressure over epigastrium. Liver dullness extends from fifth interspace to two fingers' breadth below costal margin where a smooth edge can be felt. Lower edge of spleen felt on full inspiration. Physical examination otherwise negative. Pulse 100, regular, of good quality. Temperature 98.4°. Urine, sp. gr. 1020, acid, no sugar, no albumen, Hg. 50%, red cells 3,172,000, no nucleated cells. Leucocytes 9200.

1. What is the type of anemia in this case? Typical secondary.

2. Significance of the patient's family history? None whatever. (Teacher may bring up here a discussion of the problem: in what cases is family history of value?)

3. What causes produce tarry stools? Bismuth, iron, blackberries, blood from high up in gut.

4. How do you interpret the cardiac signs here present? Functional murmur.

5. What are the commonest causes of splenic enlargement? Typhoid, malaria, rickets, cirrhosis, leucemia, anemia.

6. What causes of haematemesis should be considered here? Gastric or duodenal ulcer, cirrhosis, aneurism.

7. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment?

**Diagnosis: Hepatic cirrhosis, ruptured esophageal varix, secondary anemia, passive congestion of stomach.**

Prognosis: Probably one to two years to live.

Treatment: Stop liquor, treat anemia, regular diet. Possibly Talma's operation.

Can you give the diagnostics for the following case:

A liquor dealer, 47 years old, is seen December 15, 1904. His father died at 67 of "obstruction of the bowels", his mother at 63 of pneumonia.

Based on the information provided, the liquor dealer is presenting symptoms of an upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The symptoms of anorexia, pain, eructation of gas, nausea, and vomiting, along with the presence of bright red blood in vomit, black stools, and weight loss, are all indicative of a possible gastrointestinal bleed.

Further diagnostic tests may include:

1. Upper endoscopy: This test involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera down the throat to examine the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine for signs of bleeding or other abnormalities.

2. Barium swallow: This test involves drinking a liquid containing barium that shows up on X-rays, which allows for the detection of abnormalities in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

3. Blood tests: A complete blood count (CBC) can help detect anemia, which can indicate a possible bleeding source.

4. Stool sample analysis: A stool sample can be analyzed for the presence of blood, which can also indicate an upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Based on the physical examination, the presence of tenderness on pressure over the epigastrium, and the liver dullness extending from the fifth interspace to two fingers' breadth below the costal margin, there may be a possibility of cirrhosis. Therefore, further tests may include:

1. Liver function tests: These tests measure the levels of liver enzymes and other proteins in the blood to assess liver function.

2. Imaging tests: These tests may include an ultrasound, CT scan or MRI to evaluate the liver and other organs in the abdomen.

3. Biopsy: A liver biopsy may be performed to examine liver tissue for signs of cirrhosis or other liver diseases.

Based on the blood test results, the liquor dealer has anemia, and the red cell count is low. Further investigation is required to identify the cause of the anemia, which could be due to blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract.

**In conclusion, the liquor dealer is presenting with symptoms that suggest an upper gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to cirrhosis, and further diagnostic tests are needed to identify the cause and extent of the problem.**
